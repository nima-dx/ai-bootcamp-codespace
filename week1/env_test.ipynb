      "In a quiet valley where the grass glittered with morning dew even at night, there lived a small unicorn named Luma. Luma wasn’t the biggest unicorn, and her horn didn’t shine like a lighthouse the way some did. Hers glowed softly—like a candle behind a curtain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every evening, when the sky turned the color of blueberries and the first stars blinked awake, the woodland animals would begin to worry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the dark could feel very big.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rabbits would tuck their paws under their chins. The deer would listen for strange rustles. The owls—who were supposed to be brave—sometimes blinked a little too slowly and wished the shadows were less shadowy.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s when Luma would trot to the middle of the clearing and lower her head, as if she were listening to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you there?” she would whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the earth would answer in its own gentle way: with the faintest hum, like a song you almost remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luma’s horn would glow a little brighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not bright enough to chase the night away—because night needed to be there, too—but bright enough to make room for calm.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night, a wind came through the valley, swift and chilly. It shook the trees until they sighed and shivered. The animals huddled close, and even Luma’s glow wavered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t like this wind,” murmured a mouse, pressing against a warm stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it’s trying to steal the quiet,” said a fox.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luma took a slow breath in and an even slower breath out. Then she stepped toward the darkest edge of the clearing, where the wind curled like a mischievous ribbon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, Wind,” Luma said politely. “You sound busy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind whooshed and tugged at her mane as if to say, *Yes! I am!*\n",
      "\n",
      "Luma nodded. “Would you like a job that helps instead of startles?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind paused—just for a moment—surprised to be spoken to so kindly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luma leaned closer. “Can you carry the sleepy smells of pine and honey to everyone’s nests? Can you ruffle the leaves into a softer blanket? Can you hush your voice when the little ones are dreaming?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind swirled around her horn. It felt the gentle light there, warm as a lullaby. And slowly—very slowly—it began to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "It still moved through the trees, but now it moved like a careful hand smoothing a quilt. It still whistled, but softer, like someone humming in the next room. It carried the scent of pine needles and wildflowers, and the valley breathed easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The animals blinked and loosened their shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rabbits yawned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deer lowered their heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "The owls tucked their wings close and decided that being brave could also mean being sleepy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luma returned to the middle of the clearing and curled her legs beneath her. Her horn glowed its candle-glow, steady and patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "One by one, the animals said goodnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Goodnight, Luma,” whispered the mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Goodnight,” Luma whispered back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Goodnight, Wind,” called the fox.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind answered with a quiet *shhhh*—not a warning, but a promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above them, the stars looked especially pleased, as if they’d been waiting for everything to settle into its proper place.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as the whole valley drifted toward dreams, Luma closed her eyes and listened to the earth’s gentle hum—safe, steady, and soft.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the night wasn’t big anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was just wide enough to hold everyone’s sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Luma’s little light kept glowing, like a bedtime story that didn’t need to be loud to be heard.\n"
